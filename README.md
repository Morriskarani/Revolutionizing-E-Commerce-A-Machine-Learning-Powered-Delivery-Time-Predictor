Revolutionizing E-Commerce: A Machine Learning Powered Delivery Time Predictor


üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an e-commerce product will be delivered on time or late using machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior, logistics details (such as warehouse location, shipment mode, and weight), and order history, the system helps optimize delivery logistics for better customer satisfaction. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and achieves a prediction accuracy of 69.45% using a Decision Tree model on a Kaggle dataset with 10,999 records. The solution includes a web application deployed on Railway for real-time predictions.

üß† Machine Learning Models Used





Decision Tree ‚úÖ (Best model ‚Äì Accuracy: 69.45%)



Random Forest



Logistic Regression



K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
