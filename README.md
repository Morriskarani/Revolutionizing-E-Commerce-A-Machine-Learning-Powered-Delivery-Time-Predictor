Revolutionizing E-Commerce: A Machine Learning Powered Delivery Time Predictor


üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an e-commerce product will be delivered on time or late using machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior, logistics details (such as warehouse location, shipment mode, and weight), and order history, the system helps optimize delivery logistics for better customer satisfaction. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and achieves a prediction accuracy of 69.45% using a Decision Tree model on a Kaggle dataset with 10,999 records. The solution includes a web application deployed on Railway for real-time predictions.

üß† Machine Learning Models Used





Decision Tree ‚úÖ (Best model ‚Äì Accuracy: 69.45%)



Random Forest



Logistic Regression



K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)



Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)



XGBoost



Ensemble Voting Classifier

The Decision Tree model was selected after comparing performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

The dataset is preprocessed using SMOTE to handle class imbalance and is available for download from Kaggle E-Commerce Shipping Data (replace with the exact link if different).
MY web app link is:https://revolutionizing-e-commerce-a-machine-learning-po-production.up.railway.app/
The web app is designed for e-commerce logistics managers, business owners, and supply chain coordinators who need to predict delivery times to optimize operations. It helps them plan warehouse activities, set realistic delivery promises, and allocate resources efficiently based on factors like weight and discounts. Customer service teams can also use it to manage customer expectations, while data analysts can explore predictions to refine strategies. It‚Äôs tailored for anyone in e-commerce looking to enhance delivery performance and satisfaction
THE KEY METRICS IN THE APP ARE:
Warehouse Block: Meaning: Refers to the specific section or block within a warehouse where the product is stored (e.g., A, B, C, D, F). 
Mode of Shipment.The method used to ship the product (e.g., Ship, Flight, Road). Each mode has different speed and cost implications.
Customer Care Calls: The number of times a customer contacted customer service regarding the order (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
Customer Rating: A rating given by the customer (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) based on their experience with previous orders.
Prior Purchases The number of previous purchases made by the customer
Discount Offered: The discount percentage or amount applied to the order
Weight in Grams: The weight of the product in grams
